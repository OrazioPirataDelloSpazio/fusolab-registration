        Given a username, email address and password, register a new
        user account, which will initially be inactive.

        Along with the new ``User`` object, a new
        ``registration.models.RegistrationProfile`` will be created,
        tied to that ``User``, containing the activation key which
        will be used for this account.

        An email will be sent to the supplied email address; this
        email should contain an activation link. The email will be
        rendered using two templates. See the documentation for
        ``RegistrationProfile.send_activation_email()`` for
        information about these templates and the contexts provided to
        them.

        After the ``User`` and ``RegistrationProfile`` are created and
        the activation email is sent, the signal
        ``registration.signals.user_registered`` will be sent, with
        the new ``User`` as the keyword argument ``user`` and the
        class of this backend as the sender.
